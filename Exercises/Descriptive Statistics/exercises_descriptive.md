+ The interactions between theophylline and two other drugs (famotidine and cimetidine) were studied in fourteen patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Bachmann, et al., 1995). Of particular interest were the pharmacokinetics of theophylline when it was being taken simultaneously with each drug. The study was conducted in three periods: one with theophylline
and placebo, a second with theophylline and famotidine, and the third with theophylline and cimetidine. One outcome of interest is the clearance of theophylline (liters/hour). The data are given in the next Table. The first 8 individuals are men and the next ones are women.
