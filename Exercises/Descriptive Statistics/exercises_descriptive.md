## **Exercise 1** 

The interactions between theophylline and two other drugs (famotidine and cimetidine) were studied in fourteen patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Bachmann, et al., 1995). Of particular interest were the pharmacokinetics of theophylline when it was being taken simultaneously with each drug. The study was conducted in three periods: one with theophylline
and placebo, a second with theophylline and famotidine, and the third with theophylline and cimetidine. One outcome of interest is the clearance of theophylline (liters/hour). The data are given in the next Table. The first 8 individuals are men and the next ones are women.

## **Exercise 2**

A study was conducted to examine effects of dose, renal function, and arthritic status on the pharmacokinetics of ketoprofen in elderly subjects (Skeith _et al_.,1993). The study consisted of five nonarthritic and six arthritic subjects, each receiving 50 and 150 mg of racemic ketoprofen
in a crossover study.  

**Non-arthritic:** 6.84, 9.29, 3.83, 5.95, 5.77

**Arthritic:** 7.06, 8.63, 5.95, 4.75, 3.00, 8.04

**1** Compute the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation, for the arthritic and non-arthritic groups, separately.

**2** Construct bar plots with standard deviation e conclude.
